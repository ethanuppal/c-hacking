# C Hacking 2: Type-Safe Printf

What if there was `printf`, but it was type-safe?

```c
#include "print.h"

int main(int argc, char const* argv[]) {
    print("Hello {}! It is the year {}. Char: {c}\n", "world", 2021, '$');
}
```
```
Testing testing 1 2 3...
Hello world! It is the year 2021. Char: $
```

For this to even be possible, one needs to accept their fate and transgress into C11. One of the most interesting features in this 2011 standard is the `_Generic` keyword, which enables preprocessor-esque selection based on type. This means the arguments to the function can have corresponding type information for a limited number of types (just as normal `printf` does).

```c
struct va_arg {
    void* value;
    c_type_t type;
};
```

The interface involves a few moving parts, mainly to transform the macro arguments into something useable by a function.

```c
#define _print_apply_(x) (struct va_arg){ (void*)x, typeid(x) },
#define _print_apply(...) EVAL(MAP(_print_apply_, __VA_ARGS__))

#define _fprint(stream, fmt, ...)do {\
    struct va_arg args[] = { _print_apply(__VA_ARGS__) };\
    internal_fprint(stream, fmt, args + 1, lengthof(args) - 1);\
} while (0)

#define fprint(stream, fmt, ...) _fprint(stream, fmt, NULL, ##__VA_ARGS__)
#define print(fmt, ...) fprint(stdout, fmt, ##__VA_ARGS__)
```

Implementing `internal_fprint` required a jump table and a custom buffering algorithm until it was comparable in performance to `printf`.
